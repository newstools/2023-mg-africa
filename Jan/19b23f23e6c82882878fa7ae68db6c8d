An iconic public library in Zimbabwe’s second city faces collapse after years of structural deterioration amid poor funding for the country’s public service sector. The Bulawayo Public Library is a city landmark built more than a century ago. It is home to thousands of books that have nurtured some of the city’s luminaries, but years of under-funding have meant the maintenance of the building has all but been neglected.
